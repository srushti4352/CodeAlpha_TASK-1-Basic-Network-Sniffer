#  Basic Network Sniffer in Python

##  Project Overview

This project is a basic network packet sniffer built using Python. It captures real-time network traffic and displays essential packet details such as:

- Source IP Address  
- Destination IP Address  
- Protocol Type  
- Packet Payload (Raw Data)

This tool helps beginners understand how data flows through a network and provides insights into the structure of common networking protocols.

##  Objectives

- Capture live network packets using Python.
- Analyze packet headers and payloads.
- Understand IP, TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocol structures.
- Display key details like source/destination IP, protocol, and raw payload.
- Learn basics of network monitoring and ethical packet sniffing.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool       | Purpose                    |
|------------|----------------------------|
| Python 3.x | Programming Language       |
| socket     | Capturing packets          |
| struct     | Parsing binary data        |
| platform   | OS detection               |
| scapy (opt)| Advanced packet inspection |

##  How It Works

The program uses **raw sockets** to intercept packets directly from the network interface. It then decodes the IP header and protocol details using the `struct` module and displays them in a readable format.
